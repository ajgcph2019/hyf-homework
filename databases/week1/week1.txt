1)Find out how many tasks are in the task table
--SELECT count(id) AS count_task  FROM task;

2)Find out how many tasks in the task table do not have a valid due date
--SELECT count(id) AS  "number of tasks with invalid due date" FROM task WHERE due_date IS null;

3)Find all the tasks that are marked as done
--SELECT * FROM task WHERE status_id = 3;

4)Find all the tasks that are not marked as done
--SELECT * FROM task WHERE status_id != 3;

5)Get all the tasks, sorted with the most recently created first
--SELECT * from task ORDER BY CREATED DESC ;

6)Get the single most recently created task
--SELECT * from task ORDER BY CREATED DESC LIMIT  1 ;

7)Get the title and due date of all tasks where the title or description contains database
--SELECT title,due_date FROM task WHERE title LIKE '%DATABASE%' or DESCRIPTION LIKE '%DATABASE%';


8)Get the title and status (as text) of all tasks
--SELECT title, status.name FROM task INNER JOIN status ON status.id = status_id;

9)Get the name of each status, along with a count of how many tasks have that status
--SELECT STATUS.NAME,count(task_id) FROM task  INNER JOIN STATUS ON TASK.STATUS_ID = STATUS.ID ;

10)Get the names of all statuses, sorted by the status with most tasks first
--SELECT status.name, COUNT(task.status_id) 
FROM task INNER JOIN status ON task.status_id = status.id 
GROUP BY status.name ORDER BY COUNT(task.status_id) DESC;
