In a pan boil the cream on a low flame till it heats up and bubbles start forming on the sides of the pan.
Pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolates.
Stir well and let it cool to room temperature.
For the garnish
Melt about 50 gms of dark chocolate in a Microwave.
Pour the melted chocolate on a sheet of parchment paper and spread it thinly using a palette knife.
While it starts setting,use a heart shaped cookie cutter to make impressions on it.
Keep the chocolate in the freezer for a while and then remove the heart shaped chocolate from the parchment paper.
Keep refrigerated until use.

In a serving plate place one cake and spread 1/3 of the ganache.
Place the next cake over it and cover it with 1/2 of it.
Spread the rest of the ganache all over the cake.
Place the heart shaped chocolates over it.
Chill and serve.
